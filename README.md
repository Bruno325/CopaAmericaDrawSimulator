# CopaAmericaDrawSimulator
This Java program will allow you to randomly simulate the outcome of the Copa America 2024 draw that was held on December 7, 2023.

Upon running this program, you will be provided with the following background information about the draw's setup:
1. There are four pots with four teams, each of them based on their tournament accomplishments or FIFA rankings
2. Pot 1 contains reigning Copa America and Gold Cup winners, as well as the highest-ranked CONCACAF and CONMEBOL teams based on the 2023 FIFA World Rankings
3. The remaining teams were placed in Pots 2-4 based on their rankings in the 2023 Fifa World Rankings, with 2 CONCACAF teams from a play-in match to be played in March automatically placed in Pot 4

The rules for the draw are as follows:
1. Teams will be chosen in order of their pots. Every team in Pot 1 will be selected and placed in the first available group that does not already contain a team from Pot 1
2. The same rules will follow for the rest of the pots. They will be placed in the first available group
3. A group may not have more than 3 CONMEBOL teams or more than 2 CONCACAF teams
4. If a group were to have more than 3 CONMEBOL or 2 CONCACAF teams, that team will be placed in the next alphabetically available group

Once prompted, you may press 'enter' on your keyboard. Upon doing so, you will receive a confirmation message of the team selected from a pot and the group they landed in.
Repeat this until all teams have been selected and placed in their groups. Once done, you will be shown the results of the draw and what teams are in each group.

Happy Simulating!

Note: Two teams in the Copa America are yet to be determined. There will be two play-in games to be played on March 23, 2024. 
      Considering these games have not happened as of the time of posting this, I have assumed the outcomes of these games
      and added Canada and Costa Rica to the draw due to them being higher ranked than their opponents.
